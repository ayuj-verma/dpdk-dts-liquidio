Introduction
============================
FVL6 supports DDP(Dynamic Device Personalization) to program analyzer/parser 
via AdminQ. Profile can be used to update FVL configuration tables via MMIO 
configuration space, not microcode or firmware itself. For microcode/FW 
changes new HW/FW/NVM image must be uploaded to the NIC. Profiles will be 
stored in binary files and need to be passed to AQ to program FVL during 
initialization stage. 

With DDP, MPLS(Multi-protocal Label Switching) can be supported by NVM with 
profile updated. 
Below HW features have be enabled for MPLS:
  - MPLS packet type recognition
  - Cloud filter for MPLS with MPLS label 
Only 25G NIC supports DDP and MPLS so far.

Prerequisites
=============
1. Host PF in DPDK driver. Create 1 VF from 1 PF with DPDK driver::
   ./tools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 81:00.0
   echo 1 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:81:00.0/max_vfs

2. Detach VF from the host::
   rmmod i40evf

3. Pass through VF 81:10.0 to vm0, start vm0.

4. Login vm0, then bind VF0 device to igb_uio driver.

5. Start testpmd on host and vm0 in chained port topology, add txq/rxq to 
   enable multi-queues. In general, PF's max queue is 64, VF's max queue 
   is 4:: 
   ./testpmd -c f -n 4 -- -i --port-topology=chained --txqflags=0 
   --txq=4 --rxq=4 


Test Case 1: Load dynamic device personalization
==================================================
1. Stop testpmd port before loading profile::
   testpmd > stop port all

2. Load profile mplsogre-l2.pkgo which is a binary file:: 
   testpmd > ddp add (port_id) (profile_path

3. Check profile info successfully::
   testpmd > ddp get list (port_id)

4. Start testpmd port::
   testpmd > start port all
        
Note:: 
Loading ddp is the prerequisite for below MPLS relatived cases, operate global 
reset or lanconf tool to recover original setting. Global Reset Trigger reg is 
0xb8190, first cmd is core reset, second cmd is global reset::
   testpmd > write reg 0 0xb8190 1
   testpmd > write reg 0 0xb8190 2


Test Case 2: MPLS udp packet for PF
==================================================
1. Add udp flow rule for PF, set label as random 20 bits, queue should be among 
   configured queue number::
   testpmd > flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / udp / mpls label 
   is 0x12345 / end actions pf / queue index <id> / end
        
2. Set fwd rxonly, enable output and start PF and VF testpmd

3. Send udp MPLS packet with good checksum, udp dport is 6635, label is same 
   as configured rule::
   sendp([Ether()/IP()/UDP(dport=6635)/MPLS(label=0x12345)/Ether()/IP()
   /TCP()], iface=txItf)

4. Check PF could receive configured label udp packet, checksum is good, 
   queue is configured queue

5. Send udp MPLS packet with bad checksum, udp dport is 6635, label is same 
   as configured rule::
   sendp([Ether()/IP()/UDP(chksum=0x1234,dport=6635)/MPLS(label=0x12345)/Ether()
   /IP()/TCP()], iface=txItf)

6. Check PF could receive configured label udp packet, checksum is good, queue is 
   configured queue


Test Case 3: MPLS gre packet for PF
==================================================
1. Add gre flow rule for PF, set label as random 20 bits, queue should be among 
   configured queue number::
   testpmd > flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / gre / mpls label is 
   0xee456 / end actions pf / queue index <id> / end

2. Set fwd rxonly, enable output and start PF and VF testpmd

3. Send gre MPLS packet with good checksum, gre proto is 8847, label is same 
   as configured rule::
   sendp([Ether()/IP(proto=47)/GRE(proto=0x8847)/MPLS(label=0xee456)/Ether()
   /IP()/UDP()], iface=txItf)

4. Check VF could receive configured label gre packet, checksum is good, queue 
   is configured queue

5. Send gre MPLS packet with bad checksum, gre proto is 8847, label is same as 
   configured rule::
   sendp([Ether()/IP(proto=47)/GRE(chksum=0x1234,proto=0x8847)/MPLS(label=0xee456)
   /Ether()/IP()/UDP()], iface=txItf)

6. Check VF could receive configured label gre packet, checksum is good, queue is 
   configured queue


Test Case 4: MPLS udp packet for VF
==================================================
1. Add udp flow rule for VF, set label as random 20 bits, queue should be among 
   configured queue number::
   testpmd > flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / udp / mpls label is 0x234 
   / end actions vf id 0 / queue index <id> / end

2. Set fwd rxonly, enable output and start PF and VF testpmd

3. Send udp MPLS packet with good checksum, udp dport is 6635, label is same as 
   configured rule::
   sendp([Ether()/IP()/UDP(dport=6635)/MPLS(label=0x234)/Ether()/IP()/TCP()], 
   iface=txItf)

4. Check VF could receive configured label udp packet, checksum is good, queue is 
   configured queue

5. Send udp MPLS packet with bad checksum, udp dport is 6635, label is same as 
   configured rule::
   sendp([Ether()/IP()/UDP(chksum=0x1234,dport=6635)/MPLS(label=0x234)/Ether()
   /IP()/TCP()], iface=txItf)

6. Check VF could receive configured label udp packet, checksum is good, queue is 
   configured queue


Test Case 5: MPLS gre packet for VF
==================================================
1. Add gre flow rule for VF, set label as random 20 bit, queue should be among 
   configured queue number::
   testpmd > flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / gre / mpls label is 
   0xffff / end actions vf id 0 / queue index <id> / end

2. Set fwd rxonly, enable output and start PF and VF testpmd

3. Send gre MPLS packet with good checksum, gre proto is 8847, label is same as

   sendp([Ether()/IP(proto=47)/GRE(proto=0x8847)/MPLS(label=0xffff)/Ether()
   /IP()/UDP()], iface=txItf)

4. Check VF could receive configured label gre packet, checksum is good, queue is
